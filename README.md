# Sahih - OpenAPI Codegen
Generates Typescript HTTP Client from OpenAPI schemas.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install cargo-readme
```

## Motivation

As a Full Stack develope, you often have to write your models for the backend and some validation for that model's fields. But how do you make sure that the typing and validation are isomorphic on the client-side.
And also how to avoid that redundancy of doing that task twice.

With `sahih` you can generate an HTTP Client with the appropriate type-signatures (Typescript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 schema.

Generate types, validation and mocks for your frontend with a backend code-first approach.
